# ScanCan

This project was completed in the summer of 2022 during the Microsoft Mentorship Program

ScanCan is a recycling application paired with a 3D-printed prototype, designed to make recycling easier and more engaging. The app uses QR code scanning to identify plastic and tin drink bottles and rewards users for recycling.

# Technologies Used: Power Apps, Power BI, limited React and Django, 3D printing

Power Apps: Built the main application interface, enabling rapid app development without extensive frontend coding.

Power BI: Connected to Power Apps to provide data.

React & Django (limited use): Used for backend logic and custom components not natively supported by Power Apps.

3D Printing: Created a physical trash can prototype to demonstrate practical integration of the software with real-world recycling stations.

# Features

QR Code Scanning: Identify drink bottles as recyclable materials.

Reward System: Incentivizes proper recycling.

3D-Printed Prototype: Demonstrates how the software can integrate with physical trash cans.
